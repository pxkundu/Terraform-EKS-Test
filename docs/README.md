# Project Codebase Assessment

## Overview

This project is a scalable notification system designed with a microservices architecture and intended for deployment on AWS. It consists of application code, infrastructure-as-code, and testing suites, all managed within a monorepo structure using Nx.

---

## Main Components

### 1. Notification API
- **Location:** `apps/pt-notification-service/`
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript
- **Purpose:** Exposes HTTP endpoints to receive notification requests (such as emails), validates them, and places them onto a message queue for asynchronous processing.
- **Key Files:**
  - `notification.controller.ts`: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
  - `notification.service.ts`: Business logic for queuing notifications.

### 2. Email Sender (Lambda)
- **Location:** `apps/pt-notification-service-infra-cdk/lambda/notification-processing/`
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js, AWS Lambda
- **Purpose:** Consumes messages from the queue and processes them (e.g., sends emails).
- **Key File:**
  - `notification-processing-dummy.ts`: Lambda handler for processing SQS messages.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (CDK)
- **Location:** `apps/pt-notification-service-infra-cdk/`
- **Tech Stack:** AWS CDK, TypeScript
- **Purpose:** Defines and deploys AWS infrastructure, including Lambda functions, message queues, and other resources.
- **Key File:**
  - `pt-notification-service-infra-cdk-stack.ts`: Main CDK stack definition.

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Location:** `apps/pt-notification-service-e2e/`
- **Tech Stack:** Jest, TypeScript
- **Purpose:** Provides E2E tests for the notification service.

## Integration & Workflow
- The Notification API and Email Sender communicate via a message queue (e.g., Amazon SQS).
- The system is designed for asynchronous, decoupled processing of notification requests.
- Infrastructure is managed and deployed using AWS CDK.

---

## Initial Assessment
- The codebase is well-structured, following best practices for modularity and separation of concerns.
- The use of Nx monorepo allows for efficient management of multiple related projects (apps, infra, tests).
- The project is cloud-native, leveraging AWS services for scalability and reliability.
- Testing is integrated at both unit and E2E levels.
- The README provides a clear assessment task focused on designing a robust AWS architecture, containerization, and deployment strategy for the system.

## Next Steps
- Analyze each microservice in detail.
- Propose an AWS architecture that meets the requirements for scalability, reliability, and security.
- Prepare Dockerfiles and deployment strategies.
- Create an architecture diagram and provide justifications for design choices.
